Introduction
------------

The TOM (Target and Observation Manager) Toolkit project was started in early 2018 with the goal of simplifying the development of next generation software for the rapidly evolving field of astronomy. Read more :doc:`about TOMs<about>` and the motivation for them.

Are you looking to run a TOM of your own? This documentation is a good place to get started. The source code for the project is also available on Github.

Start with the :doc:`introduction<introduction/index>` if you are new to using the TOM Toolkit.

If you'd like to know what we're working on, check out the `TOM Toolkit project board <https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base/projects/1>`_.

:doc:`Architecture <introduction/tomarchitecture>` - This document describes the architecture of the TOM Toolkit at a
high level. Read this first if you're interested in how the TOM Toolkit works.

:doc:`Getting Started <introduction/getting_started>` - First steps for getting a TOM up and running.

:doc:`Workflow <introduction/workflow>` - The general workflow used with TOMs.

:doc:`Programming Resources <introduction/resources>` - Resources for learning the core components of the TOM Toolkit:
HTML, CSS, Python, and Django

:doc:`Frequently Asked Questions <introduction/faqs>` - Look here for a potential quick answer to a common question.

Extending and Customizing
-------------------------

Start here to learn how to customize the look and feel of your TOM or add new functionality.

:doc:`Custom Settings <customization/customsettings>` - Settings available to the TOM Toolkit which you may want to
configure.

:doc:`Customizing TOM Templates <customization/customize_templates>` - Learn how to override built in TOM templates to
change the look and feel of your TOM.

:doc:`Adding new Pages to your TOM <customization/adding_pages>` - Learn how to add entirely new pages to your TOM,
displaying static html pages or dynamic database-driven content.

:doc:`Adding Custom Target Fields <customization/target_fields>` - Learn how to add custom fields to your TOM Targets if the
defaults do not suffice.

:doc:`Adding Custom Data Processing <customization/customizing_data_processing>` - Learn how you can process data into your
TOM from uploaded data products.

:doc:`Building a TOM Alert Broker <customization/create_broker>` - Learn how to build an Alert Broker module to add new
sources of targets to your TOM.

:doc:`Changing Request Submission Behavior <customization/customize_observations>` - Learn how to customize the LCO
Observation Module in order to add additional parameters to observation requests sent to the LCO Network.

:doc:`Creating Plots from TOM Data <customization/plotting_data>` - Learn how to create plots using plot.ly and your TOM
data to display anywhere in your TOM.

:doc:`The Permissions System <customization/permissions>` - Use the permissions system to limit access to targets in your
TOM.

:doc:`Automating Tasks <customization/automation>` - Run commands automatically to keep your TOM working even when you
aren’t

Advanced Topics
---------------

:doc:`Background Tasks <advanced/backgroundtasks>` - Learn how to set up an asynchronous task library to handle long
running and/or concurrent functions.

:doc:`Building a TOM Observation Facility Module <advanced/observation_module>` - Learn to build a module which will
allow your TOM to submit observation requests to observatories.

:doc:`Running Custom Code Hooks <advanced/custom_code>` - Learn how to run your own scripts when certain actions happen
within your TOM (for example, an observation completes).

:doc:`Scripting your TOM with Jupyter Notebooks <advanced/scripts>` - Use a Jupyter notebook (or just a python
console/scripts) to interact directly with your TOM.

Deployment
----------

Once you’ve got a TOM up and running on your machine, you’ll probably want to deploy it somewhere so it is permanently
accessible by you and your colleagues.

:doc:`General Deployment Tips <deployment/deployment_tips>` - Read this first before deploying your TOM for others to use.

:doc:`Deploy to Heroku <deployment/deployment_heroku>` - Heroku is a PaaS that allows you to publicly deploy your web applications without the need for managing the infrastructure yourself.

:doc:`Using Amazon S3 to Store Data for a TOM <deployment/amazons3>` - Enable storing data on the cloud storage service Amazon S3 instead of your local disk.

Contributing
------------

If you find an issue, you need help with your TOM, you have a useful idea, or you wrote a module you'd like to be
included in the TOM Toolkit, start with the :doc:`Contribution Guide <contributing>`.
